# MakeupGuide
This is the capstone project for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.I built this application from scratch,some of the

things I used for this app are

* Content Providers

* Loaders

* You Tube API

* Picasso

* Home Screen Widgets

## Challenges

Some of the challenges I faced during building this app

* Implementing loaders as I was using them for the first time had to dig in a lot in documentation to make it work.

* Making content providers work with android oreo.I had to see  similar problem on stack overflow to overcome it.
